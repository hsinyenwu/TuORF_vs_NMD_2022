[Nonsense-mediated decay is not a major mechanism for regulating the uORF-containing mRNAs in Arabidopsis](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.16.460672v3)

The data has been uploaded to [GEO](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiUjJLUz5n6AhVrjokEHdoyCFIQFnoECAQQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fgeo%2F&usg=AOvVaw3Dc0qZ8-sNL7LwyPCWsoAr) under GSE183264. The datasets will be released to public after the paper is accepted. 
The Arabidopsis annotation Araport11 and TAIR10 genome sequence files can be found on [TAIR](https://www.arabidopsis.org)

The TuORF positions can be visualized on the [JBrowse TAIR](https://jbrowse.arabidopsis.org/index.html?data=Araport11&loc=Chr1%3A21537..32850&tracks=TAIR10_genome%2CA11-GL-Jul22%2CA11-PC-Jul22%2CSALK_tDNAs&highlight=) after the paper is accepted.

The downstream analysis is done in R and used numorous R packages. Please see each file for detail. For visualizing the distribution of Ribo-seq reads for individual genes, please use [RiboPlotR](https://github.com/hsinyenwu/RiboPlotR).
