The code provided here is for the following paper:  
[Nonsense-mediated decay is not a major mechanism for regulating the uORF-containing mRNAs in Arabidopsis](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.16.460672v3)

When possible, we showed the numbers of genes in each group and the results from statistical analyses in each panel.
